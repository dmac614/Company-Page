Codecademy project: Create a company homepage with flexbox

In this project I am creating an extremely basic version of the Muscle & Strength homepage (https://www.muscleandstrength.com/)

I am using flexbox as the page layout and practicing with media queries.

It took me a while to get my head around the concept "mobile first", however after about two weeks of research I have used this concept to make my webpage responsive and used media queries when the page breaks at certain sizes.
